1. The dataset includes various characteristics of college students and their enrollment status (enrolled/graduated/dropped out) as well as their academic success.

2. There are 4424 records in the dataset.

3. There are 35 features in the dataset.
A few examples:
- Marital status: The marital status of the student. (Categorical)
- Course: The course taken by the student. (Categorical)
- Age at enrollment: The age of the student at the time of enrollment. (Numerical)
- Application order: The order in which the student applied. (Numerical)
- Scholarship holder: Whether the student is a scholarship holder. (Categorical)

5. Using the various features, such as the ones above, we can try to create predictive models that can identify the risk factors of the student dropping out of school.

6. Since our dataset contains the enrollment status of each student, we can use the labels as a test set for a supervised learning model.
